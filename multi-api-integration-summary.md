# Multi-API Integration Summary

## Overview

We've successfully integrated multiple APIs to replace the ChatGPT-only approach for generating activities data. This new approach provides real-time, accurate data from authoritative sources:

1. **Ticketmaster API** - For real events happening in Des Moines
2. **OpenWeather API** - For accurate weather forecasts
3. **Google Gemini AI** - For additional local activities and attractions

## Changes Made

### 1. Environment Configuration
- Added API keys to `.env` file for Ticketmaster, OpenWeather, and Google Gemini AI

### 2. Backend Services
- Created `server/services/multi-api.js` to handle fetching and processing data from all three APIs
- Updated `server/jobs/weeklyUpdate.js` to use the new multi-API service instead of ChatGPT
- Updated `server/models/activity.js` to include a schema for weather forecast data

### 3. Frontend Updates
- Added a weather forecast section to `client/index.html`
- Added styles for the weather forecast in `client/styles.css`
- Updated `client/script.js` to process and display weather forecast data

### 4. Standalone Scripts
- Created `generate-multi-api-activities.js` for testing and manual data generation
- Created `test-multi-api.js` for testing the multi-API integration

## Benefits of the New Approach

1. **Real-Time Data**: Events from Ticketmaster are actual events happening in Des Moines, not generated examples
2. **Weather Integration**: Users can now see the weather forecast for the week to better plan their activities
3. **Reliability**: Multiple data sources provide redundancy - if one API fails, others can still provide useful information
4. **Richer Content**: Combination of event data, weather data, and AI-generated local activities provides a more comprehensive guide

## Testing

The integration can be tested using:

```bash
node test-multi-api.js
```

This will generate a test report in `multi-api-test-results.txt` showing the data fetched from all APIs.

## Manual Data Generation

To manually generate activities data without updating the database:

```bash
node generate-multi-api-activities.js
```

This will create a `live-activities-data.json` file with the combined data from all APIs.

## Weekly Update Job

The weekly update job can be run as before:

```bash
node server/jobs/weeklyUpdate.js
```

This will now use the multi-API service to fetch data from all sources and update the database.
